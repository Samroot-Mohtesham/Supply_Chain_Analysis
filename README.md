  <p align= "center">
    </p>
Let’s have a look at the descriptive statistics of the dataset, 
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 02 50 51" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/fd19c67c-11fe-4628-b9dc-10fa43010ce1">
  <p align= "center">
     </p>
     
## Exploratory Analysis
Now let’s get started with analyzing the Supply Chain by looking at the relationship between the price of the products and the revenue generated by them,
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 03 55" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/03fd3827-b810-4b75-b129-9c2decc7119a">
  <p align= "center">
      </p>
Thus, the company derives more revenue from skincare products, and the higher the price of skincare products, the more revenue they generate. 

Now let’s have a look at the sales by product type,
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 10 09" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/9e3c96ec-e65a-4226-bc2c-20ca3d568f76">
  <p align= "center">
    </p> 
So 45% of the business comes from skincare products, 29.5% from haircare, and 25.5% from cosmetics.
Now let’s have a look at the total revenue generated from shipping carriers,
<p align= "center">
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 12 48" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/68d28e88-7ab2-4ecf-9077-c318ac56cf00">
<p align= "center">
  </p> 
So the company is using three carriers for transportation, and Carrier B helps the company in generating more revenue. 
Now let’s have a look at the Average lead time and Average Manufacturing Costs for all products of the company,
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 52 01" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/0418a6f8-937e-4340-945e-1fe262bf66ef">

## Predictive Modeling
### Analyzing SKUs
There’s a column in the dataset as SKUs.SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. They’re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. Imagine you have a large toy store with lots of toys. Each toy is different and has its name and price, but when you want to know how many you have left, you need a way to identify them. So you give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.
Now let’s analyze the revenue generated by each SKU,
<p align= "center">
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 53 19" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/0c4ac11c-5934-49fd-b75f-bba18a9e1c8d">
<p align= "center">
   </p>
There’s another column in the dataset as Stock levels. Stock levels refer to the number of products a store or business has in its inventory. 
Now let’s have a look at the stock levels of each SKU,
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 55 04" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/883178f2-103b-4f55-a6b3-d6d42739451f">
  <p align= "center">
   </p>
Now let’s have a look at the order quantity of each SKU:
<p align= "center">
 <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 55 35" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/da3f801d-92b1-4ab9-bb18-816de5cff425">
  <p align= "center">
   </p>

## Optimization Techniques
### Cost Analysis
Now let’s analyze the shipping cost of Carriers,
<p align= "center">
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 57 22" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/3a93f67e-de69-43cf-af58-2fa5d8758645">
 <p align= "center">
   </p>

In one of the above visualizations, we discovered that Carrier B helps the company in more revenue. It is also the most costly Carrier among the three. 
Now let’s have a look at the cost distribution by transportation mode, 
<p align= "center">
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 58 27" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/1edaf779-8ef3-4b03-8db8-f94b904116ba">
<p align= "center">
   </p>
So the company spends more on Road and Rail modes of transportation for the transportation of Goods
   
### Analyzing Defect Rate
The defect rate in the supply chain refers to the percentage of products that have something wrong or are found broken after shipping. Let’s have a look at the average defect rate of all product types,
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 03 59 11" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/8e992987-7a24-430b-8884-cc38455e31f7">
<p align= "center">
   </p>
So the defect rate of haircare products is higher. 
Now let’s have a look at the defect rates by mode of transportation,
<p align= "center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 04 00 49" src="https://github.com/Samroot-Mohtesham/Supply_Chain_Analysis/assets/149721655/c6571d73-1d27-4882-bdd6-7b7486bc4408">
<p align= "center">
   </p>
Road transportation results in a higher defect rate, and Air transportation has the lowest defect rate.

## Continuous Improvement 

Continuous improvement is essential for optimizing supply chain performance and enhancing customer satisfaction. Here are some strategies for continuous improvement in the context of the Makeup products supply chain:

1. **Monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Continuously track KPIs such as inventory turnover, lead times, on-time delivery rates, and defect rates to identify areas for improvement and measure progress over time.

2. **Feedback Loops:** Establish feedback mechanisms with suppliers, customers, and internal stakeholders to gather insights, address issues promptly, and implement corrective actions.

3. **Lean Principles:** Implement lean principles such as just-in-time inventory management, waste reduction, and process optimization to streamline operations and minimize inefficiencies.

4. **Technology Integration:** Embrace emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IoT devices to automate processes, enhance visibility, and improve decision-making accuracy.

5. **Supplier Collaboration:** Foster collaborative relationships with suppliers to drive innovation, optimize sourcing strategies, and ensure product quality and reliability.

6. **Employee Training and Development:** Invest in training and upskilling employees to enhance their capabilities, promote a culture of continuous learning, and empower them to contribute to supply chain optimization efforts.

7. **Benchmarking:** Benchmark supply chain performance against industry standards and best practices to identify areas of competitive advantage and opportunities for improvement.

8. **Risk Management:** Proactively identify and mitigate risks such as disruptions in the supply chain, geopolitical instability, and natural disasters to ensure continuity of operations and minimize adverse impacts.
